       Collins was born in 1962, Connecticut, to an Air Force officer. She graduated from Indiana University with a double major in Drama and Telecommunication. Her career hit off when she began writing for children's television, such as Oswald, and Clarissa Explains it all. While The Underland Chronicles made Collins a well-known author, it was her next series that ratcheted up her celebrity status. As Collins later recalled, The Hunger Games trilogy was born while she was watching television late one night. Flipping through the channels, Collins was suddenly struck by the lack of distinction between reality TV and coverage of the Iraq war: "We have so much programming coming at us all the time," she says. "Is it too much? Are we becoming desensitized to the entire experience? ... I can't believe a certain amount of that isn't happening."
