        <h3>How to Properly set the saddle up</h3>
    </div>
 <div>
     <h3>Step One</h3>
     <p>First thing one should do when saddling a horse, is to brush the horse out. I always brush my horses out good before I saddle them uup and ride them.
     </p>

 <div>
     <h3>Step Two</h3>
     <p>Step two is the put the saddle pad or blanket down on the horses back. The pad or blanket should not be too far forward or too far back on the horse. Improper placement can cause injury to the horse.
     </p>

<div>
    <h3>Step Three</h3>
    <p>The next step is to set the saddle down on the horses back and set it in the correct placement in correlation to the saddle pad or blanket.  
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Step Four</h3>
    <p>After you get your saddle in the correct spot, everything can be hooked up and connected the way it needs to be. Starting with the front cinch, then the back cinch, and lastly the breast collar.
